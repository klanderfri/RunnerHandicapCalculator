# Runner Handicap Calculator
It is necessary to calculate the individual start times when running a pursuit race.
This program takes the qualification times (time for running 1 km) of the participating
runners and uses it to generate a table containing the start times of the runners.

## Time format
Times are provided/expected in the format &lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;, e.g 5:31.

## Example of table

4:38 - Bertil  
5:56 - Cesar  
5:56 - David  
8:21 - Erik
